## Goal

The goal is to explain practical questions in terms of abstract math

## Links about purpose

## Ideas

### todo

- gimbal lock and quaternions
- radical of an ideal, nilradical
- generalizations of eisenstein's criterion
- quantum fourier transform, shor's algorithm
- newton's identities
  - <https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4169/000298910x474998#metadata_info_tab_contents>
- spectral lines in physics and eigenvalues, in molecular orbital calcuations (uses term secular equation)

### need motivation

- jordan decomposition and corollaries
- model theory
- Curryâ€“Howard correspondence
- cramer's rule, clifford algebras, connections to physics?
- shortest distance between objects
