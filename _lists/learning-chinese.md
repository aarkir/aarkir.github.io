I'm going to try to discuss my thoughts on how to learn Chinese, and I'll try to keep this updated as my thoughts change.

## My current thoughts

College courses are useful, certainly for the first couple years.
I don't feel as if I have learned much from third and fourth year courses.
I wouldn't try to rely on Anki, unless you have better discipline at going slower and ensuring that you really understand the content first or something.
I think watching shows online can be helpful.
I don't think just travelling in China without a structured agenda for learning will help very much.
If you have a Chinese friend who wants to talk with you in the language the whole time you are there, that would be very helpful, but I don't think it's worth the time or monetary investment to just walk around by yourself for the sake of learning.

## My Experience

I first took a modern languages Chinese course at Western Kentucky University in the fall of 2015, then got tutored a bit during the winter of 2015 along with another student so that we could take Chinese Flagship program courses beginning in the Spring of 2016. 
The language flagship courses were much better and altogether very impressive.
We had one-on-one tutoring once a week with a graduate student and class every day.
In the Spring of 2016 I visited China with my high school on a grant from the Confucius Institute at WKU, and that helped cement my interest in China. 

At WashU, I just took third-level courses during my freshman year and a calligraphy course in the Spring.
I don't think I got much out of them, though my professor thought I improved, and I did learn that calligraphy is hard.
Between the summer after freshman year and the spring of my sophomore year, I did not take courses because I wasn't impressed by the ones I took in my frehman year.
I tried to learn on my own by using Anki very extensively, memorizing how to read and write characters from HSK5-6 and TOCFL. 
This was not effective in retrospect.
