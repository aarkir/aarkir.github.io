Here's a collection of goofy, pretty <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E4%BA%8C%E7%97%85">中二</a> quotes I had going for a while.

I just put whitespace-formatted quotes, like poems, in a code block to preserve whitespace.
There are a few tools to make this more natural-looking, but I haven't seen anything with just plain Markdown before.

## The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin

> Industry need not wish, and he that lives upon Hope will die fasting.

> You are young, and have the world before you; stoop as you go through it, and you will miss many hard thumps

> A Life of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two things.

> Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion

> Look round the habitable world, how few
> Know their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!

> That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously

> I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign an office.

> He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged

Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.
2. Silence.
Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.
3. Order.
Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.
4. Resolution.
Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.
5. Frugality.
Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i. e., waste nothing.
6. Industry.
Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.
7. Sincerity.
Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
8. Justice.
Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.
9. Moderation.
Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.
10. Cleanliness.
Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.
11. Tranquillity.
Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.
12. Chastity.

> Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean men - Solomon

```
Whatever is, is right. Though purblind man
  Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link:
  His eyes not carrying to the equal beam,
  That poises all above;"
```

## Death’s End

> If we lose our human nature, we lose much, but if we lose our bestial nature, we lose everything.

> The ultimate fate of all intelligent beings os to become as grand as their thoughts

> And now we know that this is the journey that must be made by every civilization: awakening inside a cramped cradle, toddling out of it, taking flight, flying faster and farther, and, finally, merging with the fate of the universe as one. The ultimate fate of all intelligent beings has always been to become as grand as their thoughts.

## A Dance with Dragons

> A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one.

## Isaac Asimov, the relativity of wrong

> The young man then quoted with approval what Socrates had said on learning that the Delphic oracle had proclaimed him the wisest man in Greece. "If I am the wisest man," said Socrates, "it is because I alone know that I know nothing."

## The Love Song of Sir Alfred J. Prufrock

```
Then love-devouring death do what he dare; 
It is enough I may but call her mine.
```

## Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman

> Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that's the end of you.

> And then I thought to myself, "You know, what they think of you is so fantastic, it's impossible to live up to it. You have no responsibility to live up to it!" It was a brilliant idea: You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to he like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing. 

> And von Neumann gave me an interesting idea: that you don't have to be responsible for the world that you're in. So I have developed a very powerful sense of social irresponsibility as a result of von Neumann's advice. It's made me a very happy man ever since. But it was von Neumann who put the seed in that grew into my active irresponsibility! 

> So I found hypnosis to be a very interesting experience. All the time you're saying to yourself, "Icould do that, but I won't"--which is just another way of saying that you can't.

## Meditations

```
As with a generation of leaves, so with men:
These leaves the wind now scatter on the ground;
Others will grow as forests bloom in springtime,
And so with men: one generation lives, another dies.
```

> Whenever you do a good deed and another has benefitted, why do you look for a third thing beyond these?

> Your actions are significant, but the locations in which they take place have no significance

> If where one can live one can live the good life and if one can live in a palance, one therewfore can live the good life in a palace

> The best defense if not becoming like your enemy

> Whether you believe in atoms or providence, you have nothing to fear

> All living things exist by convention, only the entire elements are real

> Whatever anyone does or says, I must be good, just as if the gold, or the emerald, or the purple were always saying this. Whatever anyone does or says, I must be emerald and keep my color

## Stranger in a Strange Land

> Faith: what a dirty monosyllable. - jill, why didn’t you mention that when you were teaching me the short words that mustn’t be used in polite company

## unknown

> Somebody once told me the definition of hell: “On your last day on earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become.”

## The Doors of Perception

> There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception.

## The Strangest Man

> There is no difference between time and any of the the dimensions of space except that our consciousness moves along it

John Stuart Mill

> What are the fewest general propositions from which all the uniformities existing in nature could be deduced?

P.A.M. Dirac

> God is a mathematician of a very high order

> I consider that I understand an equation when I can predict the properties of its solutions, without actually solving it.

## Rick and Morty

> Rick: Because I don’t respect therapy, Because I’m a scientist. Because I invent, transform and destroy for a living and when I don’t like something about the world, I change it. And I don’t think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to an agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it’s helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind [burp] we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I’m not a cow. I’m a pickle – when I feel like it. So… you asked.

## Frank Reynolds (eclipse)

> May the shadow of the moon fall on a world of peace

## Dune

> Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instinct

> Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.

## A Beautiful Mind

> Nash has compared rationality to dieting, implying a constant, conscious struggle. It is a matter of policing one’s thoughts,he has said, triyng to recognize paranoid ideas and rejecting them, just hte way somebody who want sto lose weight has to decide consciously to avoid fast==ts or sweets.

> Nash calmly explained that “the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously”

## Steve Jobs

> Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure – these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

## Hamlet

Act 1, Scene 5

> There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy

## Elon Musk

> I think life on Earth must be about more than just solving problems... It's got to be something inspiring, even if it is vicarious.

> Optimism? Pessimism? Fuck that. We're going to make it happen. As God as my bloody witness, I'm hell-bent on making it work.

## Evangelion

> God's in his Heaven, All’s right with the world

## Lord of the Rings

The road goes ever on

```
Still round the corner there may wait 
A new road or a secret gate,
And though we pass them by today,
Tomorrow we may come this way
And take the hidden paths that run
Towards the Moon or to the Sun
```

## Bob Dylan

> he who is not busy being born is busy dying.

## Bill Graham

> The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It’s to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.

## Robert Kennedy

> There are those who look at things the way they are, and ask why…. I dream things that never were, and ask why not.

## Lu You

> After endless mountains and rivers that leave doubt whether there is a path out, suddenly one encounters the shade of a willow, bright flowers, and lovely village

## Mahatma Gandhi

> First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

## Margaret Mead

> Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed individuals canchange the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has

## The Listeners by Walter de la Mare

> Tell them that I came, and no one answered. 

## Hitchhiker's Guide

> but the man with the odd, or rather the even, number off heads missed it

>  "Old Thrashbarg had said on one occasion that sometimes if you received an answer, the question might be taken away.”

Fenchurch:

> that you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of paper for two minutes without winning a raffle with it.

Ford Prefect:

> "Mixture of pleasure and pain,” he muttered. “Always does the trick.”

## Quotations from Chairman Mao

> Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not vanish of itself.

## Arthur C. Clarke

> Any sufficiently advanced technology will appear as magic.

## Tesla Biography
> Is nature a gigantic cat? If so, who strokes its back?” “It can only be God,” he concluded.

> When natural inclination develops into passionate desire, one advances toward his goal in seven-league boots

Have you ever abandoned yourself to the rapture of contemplation of a world you yourself create? You want a palace, and there it stands built by architects finer than Michael Angelo [sic]—aye, even finer than my friends McKim, Mead & White. You fill it with marvelous paintings, and statuary and all kinds of objects of art. You summon fairies if you are fond of them. Now, perhaps, you want to sit on a throne, and there is your throne, greater than that of Great Britain! And all your subjects are around you—countless subjects. No fellows to run after you with a pistol, as fellows do after illustrious personages, like William and Nicholas or Li Hung Chang. And if they would, what do you care? You stop their bullets in midair.
Now you walk out in the streets of a wonderful city. Perchance it is one of my cities. Then you may see that all the streets and halls are lighted by my beautiful phosphorescent tubes, that all the elevated railroads are propelled by my motors, that all the traction companies’ trolleys are supplied by my oscillators, or else that my friends of the Cataract Construction Company are transmitting all the power by my system from a far-off Niagara. And now, perhaps, you meet a tramp in the street and give him something. Five cents, you think. No, sir; you give him not less than. “$5,000,000.
Strangely, though, instead of collapsing at your generosity, he looks at you in an insolent way and turns the money in his hand and says contemptuously:—“Take it back, you mean skinflint.” And then you throw down your royal insignia and you begin to grapple with him. You are endowed with giant strength, and he is no fellow to fool with either. At any rate, the issue is uncertain. He may be stronger, and then, well—then you wake up, saved, but badly used up. If you defeat him, then you recompense him royally by giving him your insignia and your throne, and you continue your adventurous voyage peacefully and contented.
Suddenly you throw yourself in the roar of a battle, you cut and slash, and a whole army of noble knights flees before you. And now something rattles in the bushes, and you, who know no fear, you run away. Then you may witness a terribly impressive scene of years gone by. You witness the death of your father or your mother, and you go through all the agonies again. You realize the immense gulf that separates you from them. Then overwhelming desire takes hold of youto be with them again. You know it is impossible to get them back; but never mind, you will invent something, you will discover some force which will reunite those separated molecules and make them form those lovely shapes so dear to you.
And now suddenly there comes a revulsion, and you are throwing a stick at a cat in a backyard. You miss it, too, aggravating circumstance. But years afterward you can tell the exact spot on the wall, you can tell every mark of the stick, and you see exactly how the cat’s fur was brushed one or the other way. So your imagination leads you on, from sorrow to joy, from work to play, and all this world is ever present, ever ready for your pleasure and enlightenment, and at your wish and command.
```

To Robert Underwood Johnson:

> I have had wonderful experiences here, among other things, tamed a wild cat and am nothing but a mass of bleeding scratches. But in the scratches, Luka, there lies a mind. MIND.

## Dylan Thomas

> Do not go gentle into that good night

## Lilia from Ys You are the only one

```
At any moment, it is courage, then that you should I
Be aleart, stand firm to be yourself.
Courage is not a blind impulse.
It almost approaches the intimation of immortality.
Let it work alone between life and death.

Set your heart on the spirit of dignified freedom.
That is the only road to lead to yourself.

If you have not courage, there is not freedom for you.
If you have not freedom, you never be yourself.

The grace of peace be with you.
```
