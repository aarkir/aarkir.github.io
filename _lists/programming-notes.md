## Jekyll

- It seems like `pages` is a protected word for a collection, so I had to call my collection something else like `lists` and then insert this into a `pages` subdirectory
- `post.html` is the default layout in the collection `posts`
- I wasn't able to set the default layout for a collection to `page.html` after a while so I just did it manually
