## Chinese

- A great dictionary for (Traditional) Chinese is the 漢語大詞典, and you can add this to your Kindle just by dragging the Mobi to it like a book.
- I think an app like iBooks is more effective then Kindle when you have to look up many words, as the response time on Kindle is rather slow.
- Other iOS apps, eg Kindle, KyBook: I don't see much advantage over iBooks. 
- <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zhongwen-chinese-english/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde">Zhongwen: Chinese-English Dictionary</a> is recommended for Firefox
- <a href="https://www.chinesetextanalyser.com/">Chinese Text Analyzer</a>: It's great for extracting words you don't know, but running everything you read through it feels very artificial and in a vein similar to Anki.
- <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>: Be careful with it. I used it for over half a year during my sophomore year and focused too much on memorization during that time. I think that if you are careful, though, it can be useful.

- <a href="https://pinyin.sogou.com/">Sogou Pinyin</a>: Fcitx causes some weird moments of 100% CPU usage on Ubuntu, and I don't really trust such a big company to be managing my keyboard and input.
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_(Input_Method)">Chewing</a>: What I currently use with Zhuyin.
  - Issues: 
    - 靚仔 should be pronounced ㄌ一ㄤˋㄗㄞˇ, but this only allows the first character to be input as ㄐ一ㄥˋ
    - I can't figure out how to input 冚 (as used in a bad Cantonese insult), but Baidu says it should be ㄎㄢˇ
  - Pay attention to the Taiwanese pronunciation of words
    - 淆 as in 混淆 can only be input as 一ㄠˊ not ㄒ一ㄠˊ
    - many words that are pronounced with first tone in mainland china have the second tone in Taiwan
- 喜馬拉雅, and before it was discontinued 半月谈新闻快报
- for learning 注音

  - Shift+period to get interpunct (dot between names)

## Music

- <a href="https://www.everappz.com/flacbox">Flacbox</a>: This is my favorite audio app on iOS. You can add songs you want from a variety of formats from your computer without using iTunes, as is necessary on Ubuntu, and you can add these songs to playlists and browse by artist, etc.
