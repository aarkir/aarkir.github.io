## Chinese

- Dictionaries:
  - Web
    - Chinese-Chinese: zdic.net/
    - Chinese-English: https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary
  - Kindle: A good dictionary for (Traditional) Chinese on Kindle is the 漢語大詞典, and you can add this to your Kindle just by dragging the Mobi to it like a book.
- Input Methods:
  - https://rime.im/
- Podcasts:
  - 喜馬拉雅
- 注音:

  - https://typing.tw/
- notes
  - Keyboard: you can enter an interpunct with Compose+^+.

## Music

- <a href="https://www.everappz.com/flacbox">Flacbox</a>: This is my favorite audio app on iOS. You can add songs you want from a variety of formats from your computer without using iTunes, as is necessary on Ubuntu, and you can add these songs to playlists and browse by artist, etc.

## Other

- Memory:
  - <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>: It's a good tool when used appropriately.
    - <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1128979221">Chinese Support Redux</a> for getting Mandarin audio. I have been using this to practice in a way similar to dictations recently for sentences that are more complex and not as easily injective from English to Chinese.

## Deprecated

- Chinese:
  - I think an app like iBooks is more effective than Kindle when you have to look up many words, as the response time on Kindle is rather slow.
  - Other iOS apps, eg Kindle, KyBook: I don't see much advantage over iBooks. 
  - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zhongwen-chinese-english/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde">Zhongwen: Chinese-English Dictionary</a> is recommended for Firefox for English translations, but keep in mind that a Chinese-Chinese dictionary should be used when possible.
  - <a href="https://www.chinesetextanalyser.com/">Chinese Text Analyzer</a>: I tried this once, but I haven't been using it recently.
  - <a href="https://pinyin.sogou.com/">Sogou Pinyin</a>: Fcitx causes some weird moments of 100% CPU usage on Ubuntu.
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_(Input_Method)">Chewing</a>: What I used for Zhuyin with Ubuntu 18.04
  - with Chewing, use Shift+period to get interpunct (dot between names)
  - Issues: 
    - 靚仔 should be pronounced ㄌ一ㄤˋㄗㄞˇ, but this only allows the first character to be input as ㄐ一ㄥˋ
    - I can't figure out how to input 冚 (as used in a bad Cantonese insult), but Baidu says it should be ㄎㄢˇ
  - Pay attention to the Taiwanese pronunciation of words
    - 淆 as in 混淆 can only be input as 一ㄠˊ not ㄒ一ㄠˊ
    - many words that are pronounced with first tone in mainland china have the second tone in Taiwan
