This article will be a slight venture into one heavily skewed view as to how we all contribute to humanity's scientific progress.

# The End State

Being that our end state is currently unknowable, we rely on science fiction to depict where we might head. Many such books satisfy our innate desire for extremes with utopian or distopian views. Orwell's 1984, Collins' Hunger Games, Wells' The Time Machine, and Burgesses's Clockwork Orange all fit this criteria. In general, these novels show an overwhelming government that capitalizes upon its citizens and imposes harsh control on their actions. In contrast, utopian books are much harder to place. They are often only subjectively utopian, which explains how Huxley's Brave New World and Lowry's The Giver can be seen in either category. Indeed, I feel there are many that would welcome worlds like these two despite their inauthentic public disapproval of the idea of forgetting truth. In general, I find the difference between these two categories to be a matter of whether the citizens can remember any time they were happier, perhaps before indoctrination.

However, the most inspiring future is not at either extreme of pleasure or control, but rather that of freedom. Banks' Culture series is a remarkable testament to this idea. In the Culture, the individual has no power in determining the human race's advancement. However, the individual does have the opportunity to do anything they could desire, from changing their sex each week, to playing deadly card games with emotions, to surfing on lava waves and restoring their minds to a new body with brain uploading. In this world, daredevils are those to engage in life without a digital backup. This future of culture is the future we desire.

# Getting There

To reach this point, we must achieve on four fronts: science, engineering, globalization, and culture. The arrow of progress often leads in this list from left to right, then perhaps travels back, but there are isolated scenarios of uninduced bidirectional travel.

Science is pure research and discovery of both the natural world and the mathematical realm. Science affects the average citizen non-physically and only through knowledge. Engineering is the application of the basic ideas proved through science into innovations directly benefiting society. There exists a citizen such that their material life is altered in some way due to engineering. Globalization is the process of dispersing engineering ideas to a wide audience. This is necessary because past history has shown that engineering is provided only for the elite. Lastly, culture is that which citizens engage for personal amusement and is the most free form of contribution. We will now walk through the four stages in their desired order.

# Why do we not all contribute to Science?

Why do we not all contribute to science, beyond those citizens necessary to maintain the ability for everyone else to work on science? Because Engineering innovations often contribute more to science than one scientist does to his own field. The prime example of this is information transfer. Transportation allowed discussion among individual mathematicians such that their individual results could build upon each other. Google has allowed amateur scientists to begin their studies early. Thus, brilliant minds like Sal Kahn of Khan Academy may find fields other than science more significant for later furthering science. However, it must be noted that the ultimate goal of this stage of a society is purely science.

# An Individual's Choice

Thus, an individual has the ability to contribute in many ways to achieving a complete scientific understanding, where every question is provably true, provably false, not provable, or provable or not provable within infeasible constraints. Those inclined towards public affairs can move towards Globalization, where they allow new citizens to contribute. Cultural icons can promote science fiction ideals in the youth and inspire the public to support science. Engineering innovates to make science more efficient. Each of these groups contribute to the methods of scientific progress: increase the number of scientists, increase scientist efficiency, and allow scientists more time to work.

# After the scientific idealism becomes unnecessary

Assuming it is possible to reach a complete understanding of both the empirical and theoretical worlds, we will reach a state where no scientists are necessary except perhaps to uphold the past achievements of these scientists. Though we will need those able to utilize the results, there will be no more results to find. Henceforth, we should focus on engineering and allow globalization to proceed as a natural byproduct of this engineering, as processes become cheaper and more ubiquitous available. Culture will retain its use as a motivator.

Once we have built near our maximum abilities proven previously by theory, we will move to the stage of culture. At this point, we will create our own puzzles and enjoyment. This is the stage of culture. Here, the individual will have full expression of their desires. As expressed with our current imagination, one could explore fantasy worlds with virtual reality and enjoy the luxuries of an age of boundless independence free of worry. Though there may be wars and conflicts, these can be solved maximally efficiently.

# An Unpleasant Alternative

What if we instead face an unexpected threat to our civilization? As in Cixin's The Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy, the universe could be a vast dark forest with attackers squatting in the dark, waiting for naive, idealistic civilizations to send radio waves in the wrong direction. We could be pounced on any time. This theory sounds true to me after accepting the axiom that efficient space travel is possible. If extensive space travel is not plausible, we would reach the same state proposed above of eventual cultural prominence. I do not advocate for pleasure when time is short, and so I prefer a focus on progress at all costs. Progress cannot wait for potential or even likely fantasies, and we should not advocate premature pleasure in the chance of total destruction.

# Personal Contribution

One should logically choose their path to optimize their impact towards science. Novelists can focus on science fiction, educators and politicians can educate large masses and asymptotically approach equality for all, and engineers can focus on technologies like brain-computing interfaces and artificial intelligence towards solving problems. Ultimately, one should choose what they are curious about and what they can afford to explore.  

This thought experiment was considered to prove that approaches other than direct scientific contribution have worth. We all contribute to humanity, and this is one light explaining how.
